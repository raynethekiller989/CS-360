The app I developed is an inventory tracking application that uses a user ID and password to ensure only authorized users can make changes. Once logged in, users can add, remove, increase, or decrease items in a database. The app also includes a low-stock alert feature, which users can enable using a radio button in the settings menu. Inventory items are displayed in a grid view.

The app has four main screens: a login screen, an inventory grid display, a settings and notifications screen, and an add item screen. To make the UI user-friendly, I used a consistent color theme of greens and blues and made sure the screens transition smoothly to avoid confusion. This was the first app of this kind that I developed, and I followed the Android Core App Quality guidelines throughout the process.

At first, I aimed too high and tried adding too many features early on. This slowed development and led to a version of the app that had more features than functionality, so I had to start over. From that experience, I learned to first build a working version of the app, then gradually add features like notifications and menus.

To make sure my app worked well across different devices, I tested it on multiple emulated devices in Android Studio with varying screen sizes, including different Pixel phones and tablets. This step is important because while a developer might design with one device in mind, users will access the app on many different devices.

Initially, I had trouble connecting the notification screen to the menu and didn't fully understand how to link the radio button. I worked through some tutorials to figure it out and eventually got it working.

One of the parts I enjoyed most was building the login authentication screen. I also really enjoyed working with databases, including SQL, MySQL, and NoSQL, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning how to integrate databases with different programming languages in the future.
